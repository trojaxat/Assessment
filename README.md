# Data science first project

- Task 1 - Read the x/y data points
- Task 2 - Create a scatterplot
- Task 3 - Set the slope a to 10 and the intercept b to 0. Calculate y for every value of x
- Task 4 - Calculate the Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Task 5 - Find a value for a that gives the lowest possible MSE
- Task 6 - modify b
- Task 7 - How could the algorithm be improved?
